1. list out of the features of HTML5.
Ans:- HTML5 introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessors. Here's a list of key features introduced in HTML5:

1. **Semantic Elements**: HTML5 introduced several new semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, etc., which help define the structure of a web page more clearly.

2. **Audio and Video**: HTML5 added `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, making it easier to embed media content without relying on plugins like Flash.

3. **Canvas**: The `<canvas>` element introduced a drawing surface for JavaScript, allowing dynamic rendering of graphics and animations.

4. **SVG**: HTML5 added support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), allowing vector graphics to be embedded directly into HTML documents.

5. **Offline Storage**: HTML5 introduced the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs for storing larger amounts of data locally on the client-side, even when offline.

6. **Geolocation**: HTML5 introduced the Geolocation API, allowing websites to request the user's geographical location.

7. **Web Storage**: Along with offline storage, HTML5 introduced the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs for storing data locally on the client-side.

8. **Web Workers**: HTML5 introduced the Web Workers API, which allows web applications to run scripts in background threads, improving performance and responsiveness.

9. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: HTML5 added support for Server-Sent Events, allowing servers to push data to web pages over HTTP in real-time.

10. **WebSockets**: HTML5 introduced the WebSockets API, enabling bi-directional communication between the browser and server over a single, long-lived connection.

11. **Form Controls**: HTML5 added new input types like `email`, `url`, `number`, `date`, `time`, etc., along with attributes like `required`, `placeholder`, `pattern`, etc., enhancing form handling and validation.

12. **Responsive Images**: HTML5 introduced the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for `<img>` elements, allowing developers to provide multiple image sources and let the browser choose the appropriate one based on device characteristics.

13. **Drag and Drop**: HTML5 added native support for drag-and-drop operations, making it easier to implement intuitive user interfaces.

14. **Accessibility**: HTML5 introduced several features to improve accessibility, including landmark roles (like `role="navigation"`), new attributes (`aria-*`), and elements (`<figure>`, `<figcaption>`).

15. **CSS3**: Although technically not part of HTML5, the HTML5 specification encouraged the development of CSS3 for styling, animations, transitions, and more.

These features have collectively contributed to making web applications more powerful, interactive, and user-friendly.
